# Introductions

This lab calculates a set of intersection points of a set of line segments.
It should be noted, that this project does not use `cg_library`. A different approach was used at first with `generic` point structures.
The same can be calculated with the `cg_library`.

# Usage

`cargo run --release -- ../data/s_1000_1.dat`
